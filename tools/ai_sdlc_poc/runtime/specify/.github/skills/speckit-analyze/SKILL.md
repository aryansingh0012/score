## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before analysis)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_analyze` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing command invocations from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `/speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Goal.
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Goal

Identify inconsistencies, duplications, ambiguities, and underspecified items across the three core artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`) before implementation. This command MUST run only after `/speckit-tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.

## Operating Constraints

**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).

**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit-analyze`.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Initialize Analysis Context

Run `python .specify/scripts/python/check_prerequisites.py --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:

- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md
- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md
- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md

Abort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).
For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)

Load only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:

**From spec.md:**

- Overview/Context
- Functional Requirements
- Success Criteria (measurable outcomes — e.g., performance, security, availability, user success, business impact)
- User Stories
- Edge Cases (if present)

**From plan.md:**

- Architecture/stack choices
- Data Model references
- Phases
- Technical constraints

**From tasks.md:**

- Task IDs
- Descriptions
- Phase grouping
- Parallel markers [P]
- Referenced file paths

**Lifecycle Domain Scope (derive from file paths and terminology):**

- PoC orchestration domain: `tools/ai_sdlc_poc/**` (Python workflow, adapters, evidence bundling)
- Lifecycle C++ domain: `score/launch_manager/**`, `score/health_monitor/**`
- Lifecycle Rust domain: Rust workspace crates referenced by `Cargo.toml`
- Docs/requirements domain: feature docs and requirement artifacts under FEATURE_DIR

**From constitution:**

- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation

### 3. Build Semantic Models

Create internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):

- **Requirements inventory**: For each Functional Requirement (FR-###) and Success Criterion (SC-###), record a stable key. Use the explicit FR-/SC- identifier as the primary key when present, and optionally also derive an imperative-phrase slug for readability (e.g., "User can upload file" → `user-can-upload-file`). Include only Success Criteria items that require buildable work (e.g., load-testing infrastructure, security audit tooling), and exclude post-launch outcome metrics and business KPIs (e.g., "Reduce support tickets by 50%").
- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria
- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)
- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements
- **Lifecycle domain mapping**: For each requirement/task, classify expected implementation domain(s):
  - Python PoC orchestration (`tools/ai_sdlc_poc`)
  - C++ lifecycle components (`score/launch_manager`, `score/health_monitor`)
  - Rust lifecycle components (workspace crates)
- **Verification mapping**: Associate each requirement/story to expected validation mode where applicable:
  - PoC runtime behavior: targeted pytest in `tools/ai_sdlc_poc`
  - Lifecycle component/integration behavior: relevant Bazel test targets
  - Rust-specific claims: relevant Cargo test scope where crate-level validation is expected
- **Evidence/provenance inventory** (when in scope): Track expected presence and traceability of
  - `tools/ai_sdlc_poc/tooling.lock.json`
  - `tools/ai_sdlc_poc/evidence/dr009/**`
  - `tools/ai_sdlc_poc/evidence/dr010/**`
  - impact/replan/revalidation artifacts described by the constitution

### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)

Focus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.

#### A. Duplication Detection

- Identify near-duplicate requirements
- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation

#### B. Ambiguity Detection

- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria
- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)

#### C. Underspecification

- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome
- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment
- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan

#### D. Constitution Alignment

- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle
- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution

#### E. Coverage Gaps

- Requirements with zero associated tasks
- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story
- Success Criteria requiring buildable work (performance, security, availability) not reflected in tasks

#### F. Inconsistency

- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)
- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)
- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)
- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one mandates Rust implementation while another mandates C++ only for the same component)

#### G. Lifecycle Repository Consistency

- Domain mismatch: requirements mention Launch Manager / Health Monitor behavior but tasks only target unrelated paths
- Language mismatch: requirement or plan claims Python-only change while task paths imply C++/Rust component modifications (or inverse)
- Verification mismatch: requirements imply lifecycle integration impact but no Bazel/Cargo/pytest validation task exists
- Evidence mismatch: PoC requirements mention reproducibility/provenance but tasks omit lockfile/evidence artifact generation or validation
- Replanning mismatch: changed requirements are present but tasks lack impact analysis and revalidation handling

### 5. Severity Assignment

Use this heuristic to prioritize findings:

- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality
- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion
- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case
- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order

Lifecycle escalation rules:

- Escalate to **CRITICAL** when findings conflict with constitution MUST principles for reproducibility, traceability/provenance, or impact-driven replanning.
- Escalate to **HIGH** when lifecycle component impacts (Launch Manager/Health Monitor/Rust crate scope) are specified without matching validation tasks.
- Escalate to **HIGH** when PoC evidence obligations (tooling lock, dr009/dr010 artifacts, impact/revalidation outputs) are missing from implementation tasks.

### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report

Output a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:

## Specification Analysis Report

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |

(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)

**Coverage Summary Table:**

| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|

**Lifecycle Domain Coverage:**

| Domain | Requirement Count | Covered by Tasks? | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| tools/ai_sdlc_poc (Python) | ... | ... | ... |
| score/launch_manager, score/health_monitor (C++) | ... | ... | ... |
| Rust workspace crates | ... | ... | ... |

**Evidence & Provenance Coverage:**

| Artifact/Signal | Required? | Reflected in tasks? | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| tooling.lock.json alignment | ... | ... | ... |
| dr009 evidence outputs | ... | ... | ... |
| dr010 evidence outputs | ... | ... | ... |
| impact/revalidation artifacts | ... | ... | ... |

**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)

**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)

**Metrics:**

- Total Requirements
- Total Tasks
- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)
- Ambiguity Count
- Duplication Count
- Critical Issues Count
- Domain Coverage % (per lifecycle domain)
- Evidence Coverage % (required artifacts represented in tasks)

### 7. Provide Next Actions

At end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:

- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit-implement`
- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions
- Provide explicit lifecycle command suggestions appropriate to findings, for example:
  - "Run /speckit-specify with refinement for lifecycle component boundaries"
  - "Run /speckit-plan to align C++/Rust/Python ownership and validation strategy"
  - "Manually update tasks.md to add required evidence/provenance coverage"
  - "Validate PoC changes with: `python -m pytest tools/ai_sdlc_poc/test_workflow.py tools/ai_sdlc_poc/test_evidence.py -q`"
  - "For lifecycle integration impacts, run relevant Bazel tests under `//score/...` and `//tests/...`"
  - "For Rust crate impacts, run scoped Cargo tests for affected workspace crates"

### 8. Offer Remediation

Ask the user: "Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)

### 9. Check for extension hooks

After reporting, check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_analyze` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing command invocations from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `speckit.git.commit` → `/speckit-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Operating Principles

### Context Efficiency

- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation
- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis
- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow
- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts

### Analysis Guidelines

- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)
- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)
- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)
- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)
- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)
